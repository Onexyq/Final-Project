# Final-Project

This is my final project for Pic10C (Yiqi Xue) 

Description:
This is a Qt project (A game called 'The Inflating Balls') created by myself 
in which you will control a Ball tryingto "eat" all other balls smaller than you 
in order to earn scores; At the same time try not to become the "food" of your enemies.


Technically, this is a simple game but engage a lot of ideas in Advanced C++ programing
as well as GUI design. In C++, for example, the use of Inheritance/Container, STL algorithm, lambda, etc.
In Qt, for example, basic signals/slots, Piximap, KeyEvents, Qt designer. 
And the most difficult part, however, is randomization.
