# Final-Project
This is my final project for Pic10C (Yiqi Xue) 

Description:
    This is a Qt project (A game called 'The Inflating Balls') created by myself 
in which you will control a Ball tryingto "eat" all other balls smaller than you 
in order to earn scores; At the same time try not to become the "food" of your enemies.
The basic idea comes from similar games such as 'Feeding frenzy' in which the player
controls a "fish" rather than a "ball".

In Single Mode, the player will need to become big enough to win the game, and this turns out to be boring.
However, Two-player Mode is rather competitive and challenging than playing alone: you need to "eat" your opponent.

Technically, this is a simple game but engage a lot of ideas in Advanced C++ programing
as well as GUI design. In C++, for example, the use of Inheritance/Container, STL algorithm, lambda, etc.
In Qt, for example, signals/slots, Piximap, KeyEvents, Qt designer.  And the most difficult part, 
however, is randomization. That is, the position, color, and movement of your enemies should be randomized. 
Also there shouldn't be new enemies created close to you or "inside" you.

Future Usage:
    This is interesting because it is possible to create many games by making changes to this one. For example, 
    'Battle City' by adding code for projectiles, 'Pac-Man' by adding barriers, or even a game supports multiplyer 
    online. If time permits, I would like to give a try at a different time.
